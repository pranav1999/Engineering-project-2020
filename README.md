Engineering Project 2020 VIT BHOPAL

For our Simulations we have used 

Unity Engine : Unity is a real-time development platform ,The leading platform for creating interactive, real-time content
Build 2D, 3D and VR games and apps at speed. From artist tools to LiveOps.

We exported the Simulation Games in WebGL which we have later hosted the game in 

Simmer.io : simmer.io is a place for indie game developers to share their games to the web browser with a single drag and drop.They support Unity WebGL games, with more platforms coming in the future.
